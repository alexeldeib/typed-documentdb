# Typed Documentdb  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexeldeib/typed-documentdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexeldeib/typed-documentdb)


The type definition for [`documentdb`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-node.git). This is an updated version of the type definitions from Definitely Typed.
It is not yet complete, but has nearly all of the currently documented DocumentDB SDK typed, and is a significant improvement over the Definitely Typed typings.

Update `typings.json/version` to match the source version you are typing against.

```js
// typings.json
{
  "chai": "3.5.0"
  // ...
}
```
